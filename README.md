 DF Attack Tool

DF Attack Tool is a powerful, parallel request-based attack tool that can be used for educational and testing purposes to simulate high traffic loads on a target server. It utilizes multiple threads to send requests with randomized IPs and user-agents to simulate traffic. 

**Developed by**: [@A_Y_TR](https://t.me/Hacking080)

> **Important Note**: This tool should only be used in legal and controlled environments with proper permission from the target server's owner.

## Features
- Sends HTTP requests to a specified URL with randomized headers and IPs.
- Calculates the success rate of the attacks (successful vs failed requests).
- Displays real-time statistics, including the number of successful and failed attacks.

## Requirements
- Linux/Unix-based OS
- `curl` installed
- `bash` shell
- `shuf` command for randomization (usually available by default)
- Internet connection for sending requests
